## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am creating a study game that asks users to guess the next number in a pattern. It gives them the chance to try multiple times to guess the next number. It also tracks the users statistics so they can see how they've been doing.

### Features
1. User login
	2. Pattern game
	3. Ability to view and reset stats. Stats include longest streak, high score, current streak, and current score
	4. I would like to add more features past the MVP stage: I would LOVE for the computer to learn what mistakes they are making and give them hints or explain various patterns so they can take that information and apply it.
  
### Technologies
1. Python
	2. Flask
	3. MySQL/SQLAlchemy
	4. PHPmyAdmin
	5. HTML
	6. Javascript(possibly)

### What I'll Have to Learn
	1. I want to learn Javascript to make the front-end interactive.
	2. I need to focus more heavily on CSS and other formatting tools so that the site looks passable.
